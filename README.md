# Registration-form

This is my last practice project with freeCodeCamp before I take on their final project challenge for the first section of the Responsive Web Development course! So far it has been an absolute pleasure to take on the challenges and continuously learn as I progress through it all.

Today was a good practice by building a registration form with different fields for user inputs. I learned how to set different requirements for different inputs, such as the amount of characters for a password or an email format! Finished everything off with some good CSS to design the page.
